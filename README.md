## Build Frankenstein's Code Monster!
### Where do you go when you have a coding problem? 
Stack Overflow, Github, our AI overlords? These are all great solutions for finding answers to our coding problems. But how do we remember our solutions? Do we have to remember forever the repo name where we implemented a hamburger menu? Code Shelley gives us a place to store our snippets of code in organized cards so that we can find them more easily.
### Why not just Google every time?
Sure, that would likely solve the problem. But having an easily accessible place to store your code snippets will benefit you in 2 ways:
1. It's faster and easier to understand (Because you wrote it!). With the ability to star and write descriptions for your code snippets, you can quickly and comprehensively find your answers. Also, if you want to link a Github repo, you can add that as well!
2. As you continue to learn, you can retain what you learn by writing these cards. It's sorta like writing mini-documentation. And as you continue to add code, you will be less and less reliant on outside sources for your coding solutions.
